--- This library defines a data structure for sequence of values.
--- It is used in search trees (module `SearchTree`) as well as in
--- set functions (module `SetFunctions`).
--- Using sequence of values (rather than standard lists of values)
--- is necessary to get the behavior of set functions
--- w.r.t. finite failures right, as described in the paper

--- Note that the implementation for PAKCS is simplified in order to provide
--- some functionality used by other modules.
--- In particular, the intended semantics of failures is not provided
--- in the PAKCS implementation.
