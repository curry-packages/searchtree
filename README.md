searchtree: Representing non-deterministic computations as a search tree
========================================================================

This package contains libraries which define operations
to encapsulate non-deterministic computations in data structures,
e.g., lists or trees. Furthermore, various search strategies on
search tree structures are defined.

The library implements **strong encapsulation** as discussed in the
[JFLP'04 paper](http://danae.uni-muenster.de/lehre/kuchen/JFLP/articles/2004/S04-01/A2004-06/JFLP-A2004-06.pdf).

Note that the functionality of this package is largely contained
in the modules `Control.Search/...` of the
[base package](https://cpm.curry-lang.org/pkgs/base.html)
since version 3.3.0, which is part of newer Curry distributions.
