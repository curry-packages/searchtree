searchtree: Representing non-deterministic computations as a search tree
========================================================================

This package contains a library which defines a representation of
a search space as a tree and various search strategies on this tree.
The library implements **strong encapsulation** as discussed in
[this paper](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/JFLP04_findall.html).
