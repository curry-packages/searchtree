searchtree: Representing non-deterministic computations as a search tree
========================================================================

This package contains libraries which define operations
to encapsulate non-deterministic computations in data structures,
e.g., lists or trees. Furthermore, various search strategies on
search tree structures are defined.

The library implements **strong encapsulation** as discussed in
[this paper](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/papers/JFLP04_findall.html).
